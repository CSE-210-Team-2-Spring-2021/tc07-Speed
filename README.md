# Speed

Think you can type faster than your peers? Start a <i>Speed</i>
tournament and you'll know! The rules are simple. Type the words you
see as they move across the screen. Press enter to clear the buffer at
any time. Type a word correctly and your score goes up.

## Getting Started

---

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and asciimatics 1.12.0 or new installed
and running on your machine. You can install Asciimatics by opening a terminal
and running the following command.

```
python3 -m pip install asciimatics
```

After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the
project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

```
python3 speed
```

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and
click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:

```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- speed               (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific game classes)
  +-- __init__.py       (python package file)
  +-- __main__.py       (entry point for program)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
